# Live_Currency_Converter
Developing a Real Time Currency Converter using Python and Selenium for Webscraping.

This program takes the currency names as inputs from the user, along with the amount they want to convert. 
Using selenium, it searches for the currency converter on google and returns the final converted amount. It also returns the conversion rate at the time.

## Error Handling
I have also added error handling, where in case a user inputs non-existing currency names, the program will not break, but instead ask the user again for the correct input. Also in case a user does not know the exact currency name, they can also just enter the country name and the code will handle that smoothly.
